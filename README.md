=======

This repository is to develop a versions of the Divide and Conquer Algorithm (DCA) to formulate and solve the equations of motions that will make use of GPU programming resources available to a particular machine.

hybrid_DCA3 - Only CUDA 
openMPDCA - OMP and CUDA
hybrid_DCA5 - Not recursive function call
